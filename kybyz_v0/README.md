# kybyz
kibitzing website, facebook-killer. what my "goals" idea was supposed
to be but never materialized.

ideas: everything shareable, commentable, thumbs-up, thumbs-down,
whatever. use unicode glyphs rather than graphics for icons. make
everything pure html for those who want it, add web2 stuff for those
who enable javascript. everybody posts in markdown.

other ideas: everything takes place on one's own machine. app for
smartphones and tablets. server only acts as temporary cache. all
uploads to server encrypted with uploader's public key except for
sender and recipient, which are the lower half of the entities'
public keys. should also be encrypted with recipient's public key,
especially for private messages, perhaps not default for posts sent
to multiple recipients. once a public key has been shared with that
many recipients the expectation of privacy drops to near-zero.

not keeping server logs will make it impossible for agencies
to get any data.

can tweet kybyzym to other adopters by using hashtag #kybyz
followed by enough letters of message hash to make it unique to
that adopter, followed by the one-character icon plus the text.
it is fetched through twitter API periodically by client programs.

maybe can use IPOP (http://ipop-project.org/) VPNs for peer-to-peer
connectivity.
