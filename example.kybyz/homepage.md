## This is the post header. If deleted, the directory name will be used as header.
This is my `kybyz` homepage, written in `markdown` language. This line following the header is the "summary", or "short description" of the post. If there is no single line ending with a period here, a fragment of the remaining text, the "body" of the post, will be used instead, followed by an ellipsis.

Copy this entire example.kybyz directory to your own home directory, e.g.:
`cp -a example.kybyz ~/.kybyz`, and edit the files as you wish, adding other
files and directories to personalize it.

`This is some long-assed text and I want to find out if it wraps like it's supposed to, or if I screwed up the css somehow. But I have to make this long enough to exceed the screen width, and I'm not sure how much that will take. Let's see if this works.`
