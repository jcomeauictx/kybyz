This is my `kybyz` homepage, written in `markdown` language.

Copy this entire example.kybyz directory to your own home directory, e.g.:
`cp -a example.kybyz ~/.kybyz`, and edit the files as you wish, adding other
files and directories to personalize it.

`This is some long-assed text and I want to find out if it wraps like it's supposed to, or if I screwed up the css somehow. But I have to make this long enough to exceed the screen width, and I'm not sure how much that will take. Let's see if this works.`
